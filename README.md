**dd-sql**

**Why?** Created to play around with and to better understand SQL. I also use it as a form of reference; to reduce uncertainty; in the sense that if I have any doubt about what a particular SQL keyword does, I can just refer to this project.

- This project uses the SQLlite dialect of the SQL specification. 
- "SQLite understands most of the standard SQL language"
- [omitted features](https://sqlite.org/omitted.html)
- "Most dialects of SQL are 90% the same as one another as far as the language is concerned. Different dialects have different functions/different names for the same function, but most of what you can do in one SQL dialect you can do in any other."

Tools used: [SQl.js](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/), [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).
